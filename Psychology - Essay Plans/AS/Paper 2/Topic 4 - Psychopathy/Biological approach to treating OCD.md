# Biological approach to treating OCD

## A01
### Antidepressants - SSRIs
- Low levels of serotonin are associated with OCD
- SSRI drugs are used to increase serotonin levels and normalise the 'worry circuit'
- SSRIs also regulates mood and anxiety
- Serotonin is released into the synapse from one neuron.
- Targets receptor cells on the receiving neuron at receptor sites and it re-absorbed by the initial neuro
- In order to increase levels of serotonin at the synapse the re-uptake is inhibited

### Antidepressants - Tricyclics
- Tricyclics block the transporter mechanism that re-absorbs both serotonin and noradrenaline into the pre-synaptic cell after it has fired
- neurotransmitters are left in the synapse prolonging their activity and easing transmission of the next impulse

### Anti-anxiety drugs
- BZs show down the activity od the CNS by enchancing the activity of the neurotransmitter GABA
- GABA quietens many of the neurons in the brain
