# Improving the accuracy of eyewitness testimony using the cognitive interview

## A01
- Geiselman developed a interviewing technique called the cognitive interview
- It is based on proven psychological principles concerning effective memory recall.
- It is characterised into four distinct components:

### Mental reinstatement of original context
- Interviewer encourages the interviewee to mentally recreate the physical and psychological environment of the original incident.
- “What had you been doing” “What was the weather”
- Aim is to make memory accessible
- People need appropriate contextual and emotional cues to retrieve memories

### Report everything
- Interviewer encourages the reporting of every single event that happened that day even if the interviewee thinks it's not important
- “Please do not leave anything out”
- Memories are interconnected with others, so one recollection of memory can cue a whole lot of other memories
- Memories can also be pieced together by the interviewer

### Change order
- The interviewer may prompt the interviewee to give a recollection of events in reverse the order in which the events occured
- Our recollections are influenced by schemas
- If you recall events backwards, this prevents your pre-existing schema to influence what you recall
- “Tell me what happened backwards”

### Change perspective
- Interviewer is asked to recall the incident from multiple perspectives to imagine how other witnesses were doing at the time
- This is done again to disrupt the effect that schemas have on recall
- “Try to recall the incident from the perspective of another person involved in the incident.”

## A03
- Difficulties in establishing effectiveness- when it is used in the real world, there is not only just one procedure, but a recollection of related techniques. Some police departments only use one component whereas others use all of them
- Individual differences - the cognitive interview may be paticulary useful when interviewing older witnesses. Negative stereotypes about older adults memory can make a witness overly cautious about reporting information.
