# Outline and evaluate the cognitive approach

## A01
- The mind actively processes information from our senses
- Humans can be seen as data processing machines
theoretical /computer models
Schema- internal script for how to act in a given situation
Cognitive neuroscience incorporates neuroscience techniques such as brain scanning to study the impact of brain structures on cognitive processes(PET/FMRI scans)

## A03
- Models have presented to be useful to help explain internal processes
- Comparing a human mind to a machine or a computer is unsophisticated and cannot possibly be at the same level of intelligence
- Models over-simplify explanations for complex mental processes
- The approach provides a strong focus on internal mental processes which behaviourists did not do before.
