# Biological approach
## A01
- Attempts to explain all behaviour through biology
- Focuses on genetics, neurochemistry and hormones/ shows how evolution has shaped human behaviour
- Genes carry information for development of characteristics (intelligence, temperament, height)
- Genotype- the genes a person has
- Phenotype- the characteristics their genes produce
- Focuses on identifying how much behaviour is influenced by genes and how much is influenced by the environment
- MZ twins have the same DNA and have a higher likelihood of sharing behaviours and disorders
- DZ twins don't share the same DNA so there is a lower likelihood of sharing disorders
- CNS comprises of the CNS and PNS which both influence behaviour
- CNS comprises of brain and spinal cord which send messages to and from the environment
- PNS consists of the somatic and autonomic nervous system and sends and receives information to and from the CNS
- Neurotransmitters are chemicals which are released when nerve impulses reach the end of a neuron.
- Dopamine and serotonin and 2 neurotransmitters which are focused on as they are believed to affect behaviour
- Low levels of serotonin leads to increased depression
- High amounts of dopamine lead to schizophrenia
- Aggression can be explained through evolution

## A03
- Strength of the biological approach is that it can make clearer predictions regarding behaviour as it is all scientific and backed up with evidence
- A weakness of the biological approach is that is widely reductionist. The biological approach attempts to explain all complicated human behaviour just by using biology and lacks consideration in the other parts such as cognitive psychology and behavioural factors.
