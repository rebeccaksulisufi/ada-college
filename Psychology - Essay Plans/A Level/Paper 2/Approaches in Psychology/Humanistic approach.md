# Humanistic approach

## A01

- Maslow was determined to look for the best in people rather than the worst
- Maslow developed a hierarchy of needs
- At the bottom were the most important needs (physiological needs)
- At the top were the most complex (self actualisation)
- (1)physiological (2)safety (3)love and belonging (4)esteem (5)self-actualisation
- Maslow found that most who reached self-actualisation, tended to be more creative, accepting, and had an accurate perception of the wold around them
- The self is how we perceive ourselves as a person
- People have 2 basic needs: UPR, and feeling of self worth
- Feelings of self-worth develop in childhood and are formed by the child's relationship with their parents
- When there is a similarity between ones ideal self and actual self, a state of congruence exists and our self-esteem is higher
- When there is more of a difference between our ideal self, and our actual self, the state of incongruence exists and our self-esteem is lower
- When people experience **conditional** positive regard, they develop conditions of worth where they believe they will only be accepted if they meet the expectations that others have set as conditions of acceptance.
- Maslow was also a firm believer in free will and believes that people have full conscious control over their destiny.

## A03

- Cultural differences exist as shown in cross-cultural studies
- In China, belonging took priority over physiological needs and self-actualisation was related to contribution to society rather than individual development.
- China is a more collectivist culture and focus more on social relationships then personal development
- Therefore Maslow's hierarchy may not be suitable for all cultures

***

- Research with adolescents show evidence of individuals who experience **conditional regard** are more likely to display 'false behaviour'
- They will do things to meet other expectations even when it clashes with their own views
- Harter discovered teenagers who feel that they have to meet certain conditions in order to gain their parents approval frequently ended up not liking themselves
- They would create a 'false self', one in which their parents would love, but they would then be more likely to develop depression, and lose touch with their own true self

***

- A limitation is that counselling cannot be tested experimentally due tot he rigorous requirements of the experimental method
- Rogers believed human behaviour extended beyond the principles of science because we have free will
- Studies have shown personal growth as a result of Humanistic counselling but these don't show that the therapy caused the changes
- So it is difficult to evaluate the therapy scientifically
