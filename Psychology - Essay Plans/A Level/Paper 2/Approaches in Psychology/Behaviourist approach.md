# Behaviourism as an approach in psychology
## A01
- Behaviourist approach is concerned with observable stimulus-response behaviours
- All behaviours are learned through interaction with the environment
- We learn new behaviour though classical or operant conditioning
- When we are born our mind is ‘tabula rasa’ (blank slate)
- Only external observable behaviour can be scientifically measured
- Internal thoughts or thinking should be explained through behavioural terms or eliminated altogether
- No distinction between human and animal behaviour (research can be carried our on animals instead of humans)

## A03
- The behaviourist approach provides clear predictions that can. This means that explanations can be scientifically tested and support with evidence.
- Humanistic (can't compare humans to animals)
- Ignores biology (testosterone influences our behaviour and affects our environment
