# Ways of investigating the brain

# Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)

### A01

- Measures changes in brain activity while a person performs a task
- Measures the change in blood flow in articular areas of the brain
- If an area of the brain becomes more active, there is an increased demand for oxygen
- Brain responds by increasing blood flow

### A03

- Non-invasive and doesn't expose the brain to harmful radiation
- Offers a more objective and reliable measure of psychological processes

***

- As fMRI changes blood flow, it is not a direct measure of neural activity in particular brain areas

# Electroencephalogram (EEG)

### A01

- Measures electrical activity in the Brain- Electrodes placed on scalp detect small electrical charges from activity of the brain cells
- EEG data can be used to detect various types of brain disorders (epilepsy)
- Four patterns: alpha, beta, delta, theta

### A03

- Provides a recording of the brain in real life rather than an image of a passive Brain
- Useful in clinical diagnosis as it records abnormal neural activity
- Cannot detect activity in deeper regions
- EEG signals are not useful for pinpointing the exact source of activity



# Event-related potentials (ERPs)

### A01

- Small voltage changes in the brain that are triggered by specific events
ERPs are difficult to pick out from all the other electrical activity being generated within the Brain

### A03

- ERPs provide a continuous measure of processing in response to a particular stimulus, makes it possible to determine how processing is affected by specific experimental manipulation
- ERP can measure the processing of a stimuli even in the absence of a behavioural response
- Takes a large number of trials to gain meaningful data
- Only strong voltage changes generated across the scalp are recordable

# Post-mortem examinations

### A01

- Can be used to study brain when people are dead
- Can also identify brain structures involved in memory
- find lesions

### A03

- Allow for a more detailed examination, allows them to look deeper in the Brain
- helps understand schizophrenia
- Factors can affect post-mortem Brain
- Person is already dead
