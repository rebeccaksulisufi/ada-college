# Unit 2

## Internal components of a computer

### SSD
- A printed circuit board which expands the use of a system

### Hard Disk
- Stores software permanently (OS/utilities/applications)

### CPU
- The central processing unit of the whole unit

### RAM
- Stores software when power is on
- Can use multiple modules to increase memory

### ROM
- Contains boot code permanently
- Contains basic input/output handling code

### Motherboard
- Printed circuit board that connects CPU to inputs, outputs and storage
- Usually has ROM pre-mounted

| Factors to consider |                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Performance         | CAPACITY/SPEED/EFFICIENCY/RELIABILITY  |
| Cost                | COST OF PURCHASE/LIFETIMECOST/TRAINING |
| Timescale           | LEAD TIME/IMPLEMENTATION TIME          |
| Form                | LENGTH/WIDTH/DEPTH/STYLE               |
| Compatability       | WILL SOFTWARE WORK WITH HARDWARE       |
| User                | DOES IT MEET THE USERS NEEDS           |

## How does a hard disk work?
- Disk spins at high speed rotating aronf the tracks
- Arms moves in and out quickly to different parts of a secrion
- Reads or writes from the track sector to the disk controller
- The controller interrupts the CPU which moves data to main memory

## Disk cache
- Memory buffer with the dsk system or part of the RAM
- Holds data likely to be needed next (frequent data)
- Speeds up data tranfer

## SSD **Advantages**
- Like a disk logically but a memory physically
- Do not require mechanical operation
- Have no moving parts
- Consume little power
- Do not overheat
- Operate while moving
- Small and light
- Fast access

## Network attached storage (NAS)
- Is a server operating only to serve files to network clients
- Can automate backup

#### Advantages:
- Fault tolerance
- Shared mass storage
- Incorporates backup
- Manageable onsit (cloud storage)

## RAID
- Redundant array of independant disks
