# Authoritarian personality

## A01
- The Authoritarian personality provides a possible explanation why some individuals require little pressure to obey.
- The F scale was used by Adorno to measure the different components that made up the Authoritarian personality.
- Agreeing with statements in the F scale was indicative of having an authoritarian personality
- Adorno also found that people that scored high on the F scale were tended to have been raised by parents who used an authoritarian parenting style
- If people tend to grow up in an authoritarian family, they acquire the same authoritarian attitudes through a process of learning.
### Elms and Milgrams
- Used 20 obidient participants from Milgrams earlier study (those who continued to 450v) and 20 defiant participants (whose who had refused to continue at one point in the study)
- Each participant completed the F scale to measure their levels of authoritarianism.
- Paticipants were also asked questions about their relationship with their parents and their attitudeto the learner and the experimenter during their participation in Milgrams original study
- The researchers found higher levels of authoritarianism amond participants which were classified as obidient rather than defiant
- Obidient participants reported being less close to their fathers and used negative terms to describe them

## A03
  - Milgram showed that variations in the social context of the study were the primary cause of different levels of obdience not variations in personality. Relying on an explanation of obdience based purely on authoritarianism lacks the flexibility to account for these variations
  - When Elms and Milgram asked participants about their upbringing, many of the fully obidient participants reported having a good relationship with their parents rather than having grown up in the overly strict family environment which is commonly associated with their authoritarianpersonality
