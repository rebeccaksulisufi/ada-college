# Situational variables affecting obdience // Milgrams study

## A01
- 40 participants were told they were involved in a study on how punishment affects learning
- A learner (who was always the confederate), a teacher who was always the volunteer
- The teacher and the learner would draw straws and the naive participant would always be the teacher
- Teacher was required to test the learners ability on word pairs
- Everytime the learner would get a wrong word pair, the teacher would administer an electric shock starting at 15v going all the way up tp 450v
- The learner would mostly give wrong answers
- If the learner hesitated, the experimenter would give a series of prods.
- All particpants administered the 300v shock
- 65% went up to 450v

### Situation factors in obdience
#### Proximity
Milgram found that the proximity of the authority figure has an effect on obidience rate. Some teachers would tell th experiementer they were conducting a higher voltage over the phone but were actually giivng lower volts.

#### Location
Several participants remarked that the location of the stude gave them confidence to do the shocks as they were in a prestigious place and said they wouldnt have shocked the learner if they were elsewhere.
Whent he study was conducted in a run-down office, obidience rates dropped but not by alot. Only 48%.

#### Uniform
Uniform can have a powerful effect on obidience. People in uniform can be easily recognised and convey power and authority.

## A03
- Lack of realism- the learner cried out in pain but the experiementer stayed calm which could lead to the participant guessing that the victim is not suffering any real harm
- Ethical issues- Milgram deceived his participants by telling them they were involved in a study on the effects of punishment on learning rather then telling themthe actual aim of the study which makes it impossible for participants to make an informed decision before giving their consent
