# Bowlbys theory of maternal deprivation

## A01
- Bowlby proposed that prolonged emotional deprivation would have long-term consequences in terms of emotional development
- The findings from Bowlbys 44 thieves study came as a surprise because no one had considered the long-term importance that the effects of seperation had on infants and children
- Bowlby believed it wasnt enough for a child to be warm and fed
- He believed that children needed a warm intimate and continuous
- Bowlby believed that a young child who is denied care in their critical periodmay become emotionally disturbed
- Bowlby suggested that the long-term consequence of deprivation was mental health problems

### 44 juvenile thieves
- Analysed a number of patients in the Child guidance clinic where he worked
- All the children there were emotionally maladjusted
- He studied 88 children
- 44 had been caught stealing
- 44 were the control group
- Bowlby suggested that some of the thieves were affectionless psychopaths (lacked signs of effection/affect/shame)
- Bowlby found that those diagnosed as affectionless thieves had experienced frequent early seperations from their mother
- 86% of affectionless thieves experiences frquent seperations compared with 17% of the other thieves
- almost none of the control participants experiences earl seperations
- 39% of all thieves had experienced early seperations
- Findings show early seperation is linked to affectionless psychopathy

## A03
- When talking about deprivation, people assume it is a physical deprivation that is the cause, when infact it could also be psychological. A mother that is depressed may not be able to provide suitable emotional care thus depriving her children of that care
- Bowlby studied children with tuberculosis when they were in hospital. The nurses were unable to provide them with efficient emotional care. They were only visited once a week. Bowlby found no significant intellectual differences between children with TB and normal children
