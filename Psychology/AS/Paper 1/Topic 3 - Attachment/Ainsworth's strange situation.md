## A01

- Systematically test the nature of attachment
- To see how infants aged 9-18 months behave in novelty situations
- 100 middle-class American infants (9-18 months) and their mothers
- Controlled observation within a laboratory setting
- Variables are regulated by the researcher
- 9X9 foot space split into 16
- Toys and 2 chairs in the room
- Procedure consisted of 8 episodes (1) parent and infant play (2) parents sits while infant plays (3) stranger enters and talks to parent (4) parent leaves, infant plays, stranger offers comfort (5) parents returns, stranger leaves (6) parents leaves infant alone (7) stranger enters and offers comfort (8) parents returns, offers comfort
- The observation of infants response to stranger anxiety, separation anxiety, and reunion behaviour
- Found 3 types of attachments
- (1) secure attachment
- Those who have secure attachments to their caregiver
- Do not cry when caregiver leaves the room
- Does not show distress when stranger enters
- Easily soothed
- (2) insecure-avoidant
- Avoid social interaction
- Show little response to seperation
- Do not seek proximity of caregiver on reunion
- (3)
- Both seeks and resists intimacy and social interaction
- On reunion, they display conflicting desires for and againsy contact


## A03
- Demand characteristics as the mothers could have acted differently in the study, such as being more affectionate with thei child not as they'd usually be to look good in the study (also referred to as social desirability bias) so the results could be different due to the different behaviour of the mothers.
- Main and Soloman analysed over 200 videos from the Strange Situation and proposed there is a fourth type of attachment insecure-disorganised where there is a lack of consistent social patterns in behaviour. They show strong attachment behaviour followed by avoidance and looking fearful towards their caregiver
