# Interference as an explanation for forgetting

## A01
- Forgetting occurs because memories interfere with and disrupt another

### Proactive interference
- Cannot learn a new task because of an old task that has been learn. (OLD MEMORIES DISRUPT NEW MEMORIES)

### Retroactive interference
- Forget a previous learn task due the learning of a new task.  (NEW MEMORIES DISRUPT OLD MEMORIES)

### Underwood & Postman:
- Participants were split into 2 groups
- Both groups had to remember a list of word pairs
- The second group had to remember another list of words where the second word from each word pair was different
- All participants were asked to recall words from the first list
- The recall of the first group was more accurate
- Suggests learning the second list interfere with  the participants ability to recall the list (RETROACTIVE INTERFERENCE)


## A03
- Low ecological validity as the majority of research into the role of interference has been carried out in laboratory which does not frequently occur to real life so it may not be possible to generalise the findings.
- Since the study is carried out in laboratory setting, it is more likely to provoke demand characteristics as the participants may be able to guess the aim of the study and act different accordingly.
