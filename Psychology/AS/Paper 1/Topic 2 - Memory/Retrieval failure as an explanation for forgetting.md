# Retrieval failure as an explanation for forgetting

## A01

- Retrieval failure occurs when information is available in LTM but is unable to be recalled due to the absence of appropriate cues
- When a new memory is stored, so is information about the situation and these are known as retrieval cues

### Retrieval cues can be:

#### Context
- External cues in the environment (smell, place)

#### State
- Bodily cues inside of us (mood, emotion)

#### Organisation
- Recall is improved if the organisation gives a structure which provides triggers

#### Goodwin:
- Studied the effect of alcohol on state-dependant retrieval
- They found that when they encoded when they were drunk, they were more likely to recall it in the same state

## A03

- Ecological validity can be questions but the findings still support evidence from outside the lab. People can't remember much about their childhood, but upon returning to their childhood house, but upon returning to the house it provides retrieval cues which trigger a flood of memories
- People tend to remember material better when there is a match between their mood at learning and at retrieval. The effects are stronger when a participant is in a positive mood rather than a negative mood. They are also greater when people try to remember events having personal relevance.
