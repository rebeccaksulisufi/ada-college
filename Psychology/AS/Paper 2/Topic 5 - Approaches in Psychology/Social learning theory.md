# Social learning theory as an approach in psychology
## A01
- BANDURA agreed which behaviourists which believe that behaviour is learnt through experience
- We learn through observation and imitation of other people's behaviour
### Stages:
#### Attention:
A child must pay attention to the act of aggression which is being carried out by a role model

#### Retention:
Storing the observed behaviour in the long term memory, imitation isn't always immediate

#### Reproduction:
Individual must have the ability to reproduce the observed behaviour
### Motivation:
Individuals must expect to receive the same positive reinforcement

**IMITATION IS MORE LIKELY IF WE IDENTIFY WITH THE MODEL (SEX,AGE)**

### Bobo doll study:
- Group 1: 12 boys 12 girls were shown model hitting doll with hammer and shouting
- Group 2: 12 boys 12 girls were shown model that was not aggressive
- Group 3: 12 boys 12 girls were shown NO model
#### Results:
Group 1 was the most aggressive. Boys were more physically aggressive. Girls and boys were equally verbally aggressive
#### Conclusion:
Supports SLT as it shows children imitate behaviour of the role model even if the behaviour is aggressive

## A03
- SLT by BANDURA was a lab experiment and did not affect participants in real life. Children were aggressive towards a doll which they know can not feel pain, the children may have acted differently if it was another child.
- The theory does not explain why the boys imitated the physical aggressive behavior more than the girls. Other factors must be involved such as biological factors like testosterone.
- SLT can explain the difference of behavior between different cultures as if a behavior is not displayed it cannot be imitated, this can explain why groups such as the Amish are non-violent.
