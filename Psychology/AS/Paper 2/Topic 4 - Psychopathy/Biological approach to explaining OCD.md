# Biological approach to explaining OCD

## A01

### Genetic explanations
- A popular explanation for mental disorders is that they are inherited

#### The COMT Gene
- COMT gene regulates the production of dopamine which is found more commonly in patients in OCD

#### The SERT Gene
- SERT gene affects the transportation of serotonin which causes lower levels of this neurotransmitter
- Lower levels are implicated in OCD

### Neural explanations

#### Abnormal levels of neurotransmitters
- Dopamine levels are abnormally high in patients with OCD
- Serotonin levels are abnormally low in patients with OCD
- Antidepressant drugs that increase serotonin levels, show to reduce the symptoms of OCD, those who have less effect on serotonin does not reduce OCD symptoms

#### Abnormal brain circuits
- The caudate nucleas suppresses signals from the orbifrontal cortex
- Orbifrontal cortex sends these signals to the thalamus about worrying things
- When the caudate nucleus is damaged it fails to suppress hese worrying thoughts which alerts the thalamus which in turns sends a signal back to the orbifrontal cortex acting as a worry circuit
- Supported by PET scans of patients with OCD, taken while their symptoms are actibe (holding a dirty cloth). Scans show heightened activity in the orbitfrontal cortex

## A03
- A study shows that people with a first degree relative with OCD is 5 times more likely of having the illness themselves at some point in their lives compared to the general population
- Psychologists studied patients with Touettes and concluded that OCD is one expression of the same gene which determines Tourettes. The obsessive behaviour of OCD and Tourettes patients is also found in autism.
