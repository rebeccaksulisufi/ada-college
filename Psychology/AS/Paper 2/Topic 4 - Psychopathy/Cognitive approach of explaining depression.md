# Cognitive explanation of depression

## A01
- The cognitive approach states that mental illnesses are caused by learned biases of cognition
- In particular, depression is caused by irrational, maladaptive, and negative thoughts
- Beck described the cognitive triad of thoughts about the self, the world, and the future (put example here)
- Depressive people draw illogical conclusions which lead to a distorted reality (E.g magnification- tendency to exaggerate the significance of an event OR minimisation- tendency to underplay a positive event
- Negative treatment in childhood can create negative schemas
- For example someone displaying personalisation might think that everyone was talking about them
- Ellisâ€™ ABC model / ACTIVATING EVENT- objective situation / BELIEF - client writes down the negative thoughts that occurred to them / CONSEQUENCES - negative feelings

## A03
- It has practical applications for the treatment of depression (CBT)
- The study cannot establish if cognition actually caused the depression- cannot establish what the initial component was that triggered the depression- study might not be correlational
- Nurture explanation- depression may be multi-causal/depression is caused by both psychological and biological factors.
