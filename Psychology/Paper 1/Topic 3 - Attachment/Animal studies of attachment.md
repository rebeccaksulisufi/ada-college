# Animal studies of attachment

## A01

### Lorenz
- Lorenz took gosling eggs and divided them into 2 groups 
- One group was left with their natural mother while the other eggs were placed in an incubator
- When the incubator eggs hatched, they saw Lorenz and started following him around 
- To test imprinting, Lorenz marked the 2 groups to distinguish them and placed them tohether 
- Both Lorenz and their natural mother was present
- The group that saw Lorenz first followed Lorenz around
- The group that stayed with their natural mother followed her around
- This process of imprinting is called a critical period
- The animal will imprint to a persistently moving object within its first two days called a 'critical period'

### Harlow
- Created 2 wire mothers with different 'heads'
- One wire mother was wrapped in soft cloth
- 8 monkeys were studyed for 165 days
- 4 of the monkeys milk bottles were on the wire mother
- 4 of the monkeys milk bottles were on the cloth mother
- All 8 monkeys spend most of their time  with the cloth mother regardless whether or not the cloth mother had the feeding bottle
- When frightened, the monkeys would cling to the cloth mother 
- Shows that infants do not develop an attachment to the person who feeds them but to the person offering contact comfort

## A02
- Confounding variable - Harlow's studying also had different types of heads for the objects which could act as a confounding variable because it varies systematically with the independant variable  
- Generalising animal studies to human behaviour - humans differ in important ways from animals. Animal studies can act as a useful pointer in understanding human behaviour but confirmation should be seeked when looking at human research.
