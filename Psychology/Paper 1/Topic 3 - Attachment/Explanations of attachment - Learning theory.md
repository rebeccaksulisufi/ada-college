# Explanation of attachment: learning theory

## A01

- Learning theory proposes that all behaviour is learned
- When children are born, they have a tabula rasa

### Classical conditioning
- First investigated by Pavlov
- Unconditioned stimulus = Food
- Unconditioned response = Pleasure
- Neutral stimulus = Infants mother
- Conditioned stimulus = Infants mother
- Unconditioned response = Feeling of pleasure

### Operant conditioning 
- First investigated by BF Skinner
- Dollard and Miller showed an explanation of attachment based on operant conditioning and drive reduction theory
- A drive is something that morivates behaviour
- When an infant is fed, drive is reduced and produces a feeling of pleasure
- This is negative reinforcement 
- Food becomes a primary reinforcer because it supplies the reward
- Attachment occurs because the child seeks the person who can supply the reward

## A03

- Drive reduction theory is ignored.There are things that people do that increase discomfort (bunjee jumping)
- Learning theory is based on research with animals. Behaviourists believe that humans are different to animals in terms of learning.
