# Influence of early attachment on childhood

## A01
- Bowlbys concept of the internal working model is similar to a schema
- An infant learns about a relationship from experience
- Infant learns what relationships are and how partners in a relationship behave towards eachother
- Its a operable model of self and attachment partner

### Hazan and Shaver
- Designed a study to test the internal working model
- 'Love quiz' in 'Rocky mountain news'
- Quiz asked questions about current attachment experiences and attachment history to identify current and childhood attachment types
- Also asked questions about attitudes towards love, an assessment of the internal working model
- Analysed 620 responses
- Found that attchment styles were similar to infants
- 56% secure
- 25% avoidant
- 19% resistant
- Found positive correlation between attachment type and love experiences
- Securely attached adults described their love experiences as happy friendly and trusting
- Found a relationship between the conception of love and attachment type
- Securely attached individuals tend to have a positive internal working model

## A03
- The research suggests that early experiences have a fixed effect on later adult relationships and children that are insecurely attached at 1 years old are doomed to experience emotionally unsatisfactory relationships as adults. This is not the case as researchers have found plenty of other instances where participants were experiencing happy adult relationships despite not being securely attached as an infant
- Not all research has found a strong positive correlation between early attachment and later relationships. Fraley reviewed 27 samples where infants were assessed in infancy and later reassessed. He found correlations from .50 to .10 (low). Such correlations do not suggest those attchment types are stable.
