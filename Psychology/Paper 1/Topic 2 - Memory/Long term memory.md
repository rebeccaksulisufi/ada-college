# Outline and evaluate long term memory

## A01

- Tulving proposed a distinction between procedural, semantic and episodic memory

### Procedural
- Knowing how to do things (unconscious/automatic)

### Semantic 
- Storing information about the world (London is the capital of England)

### Episodic
- Stores information about our lives that we have experiences

### Clive Wearing
- Musician who suffered brain damage from a viral infection
- Suffered from amnesia
- Lost the ability to encode new long term memories
- Lost episodic memory
- Still has semantic memory- when his wife enters the room, he greets her as he hasn't seen her for years

## A03
- Evidence comes from research on patients with amnesia. Amnesic patients have great difficulty in retaining episodic and semantic memory
- Memory for events and knowledge acquired before the condition tends to remain intact but they cant store new episodic and semantic memories. Their ability to retain declarative information is impaired
