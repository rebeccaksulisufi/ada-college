# Outline and evaluate research methods into short and long-term memory

## A01

### Short term memory
- Is for immediate events which are measured in seconds. They disappear unless rehearsed

#### STM has 3 main aspects:
##### Capacity
- Only 7+/- 2 items can be stored at a time

##### Duration
- In the STM, items and not usually stored more than 18 seconds

##### Encoding
- In the STM, the type of encoding used is acoustic encoding.

##### CAPACITY:
- Jacobs used the span-measure test with every letter in the alphabet and numbers apart from “w” and “7” as they has 2 syllables
- He concluded people find it easier to recall numbers rather than letters
- The average span for letters was 7.3 and for numbers was 9.3

##### DURATION:
- Atkinson and Shiffrin stated that the duration of STM is between 15 and 30 seconds.
- They can be kept in the STM by repeating them using acoustic encoding
- Peterson and Peterson showed that the longer the delay, the less information is recalled which shows a limited duration.

### Long term memory
- Is for events that have happened in the past.
#### LTM has 3 main aspects:

##### Capacity
- LTM has no capacity

##### Duration
- Could last from 2 minutes to 100 years

##### Encoding
- LTM uses semantic encoding but may sometimes also be acoustic

- Bahrick et al investigated LTM where after 48 years of a participants graduation, they were asked to recall names of people in a graduate photo and was only 30% accurate


## A03
- Demand characteristics - the participants could guess the aim of the study and could either perform extremely well or extremely bad to hinder the experiment
- Ecological validity-  a situation where participants would have to memorise lists of numbers and/or words would not occur in real life and is not a good measure of memory.
