# Outline and evaluate the multi-store model

## A01
- Proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin
- Consists of 3 stores: sensory register, short term memory, long term memory
- Information passes from store to store in a linear way
- Both STM and LTM are liner stores
- Each store has its own characteristic in terms of encoding, capacity and duration
- Encoding = the way information is changed so it can be stored in the memory (visual, acoustic, semantic)
- Capacity = concerns how much information can be stored
- Duration = refers to the period of time information can last in memory stores

### Sensory register:
- Duration = Â½ second
- Capacity = all sensory experience
- Encoding = sense specific

### Short term memory:
- Duration = 0-18 seconds
- Capacity = 7 +/- 2 items
- Encoding = acoustic

### Long term memory:
- Duration = unlimited
- Capacity = unlimited
- Encoding = semantic

## A03
- Gives a good understanding of the structure and process of the STM which allows researchers to expand on this model which means researchers can do experiments to improve the model and make it more valid
- STM and LTM are more complicated than thought. Baddeley and Hitch proposed the working memory model which shows that STM is more than just one unitary store and has different components (central executive, phonological loop)
