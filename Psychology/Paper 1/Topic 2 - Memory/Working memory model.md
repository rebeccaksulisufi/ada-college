# Outline and evaluate the working memory model

## A01
- Baddeley and Hitch replaces the idea of a unitary STM by suggesting a system involving active processing and short-term storage of information

### Central Executive:
-Supervisory function
-Acts as a filter, determining with filter is attended to
-Processes information in all sensory forms
-Directs information to other slave systems
-Limited capacity/deals with one piece of information at a time

### Phonological Loop:
- Hold auditory information
- Has 2 parts (1) phonological store- which stores words you here (2) articulatory process- which allows maintenance rehearsal
- Plays a key role in the development of reading

### Visuospatial Sketchpad:
- Holds visual information
- Has 2 parts (1) visual cache- which stores visual data about the form and colour (2) the inner scribe- records the arrangement of objects in the visual field and transfers information in the visual cache to the central executive

### Episodic Buffer:
- Acts as a temporary store for information which acts as a tmp store for information which communicates with both LTM and the slave system components of working memory

## A03

- Working memory is supported by dual task studied. It is easier to do 2 tasks at the same time is they use different processing systems than if they use the same slave system. Participants would find it hard to do 2 visual tasks because they would be competing for the same limited resources
- Little is known about the central executive and how it works, it is an important part of the model but it is unclear

### The KF study
- Supports the working memory model
- KF suffered brain damage from a motorcycle accident which damaged his short-term memory
- Impairment was mainly for verbal information
- Memory for visual information was largely unaffected
- Shows that there are separate STM components for visual/verbal information
