# Role of social influence processes in social change

## A01
- There is the presence of a consistent minority.
- If the minority remains consistent in their message people will start to conform (convert).
- The minority then starts to get bigger and reach 'critical mass'.
- Then more and more people will start to conform because it is majority behaviour (normative social influence).
- Social cryptoamnesia then occurs. Once a change becoms a majority, people forget how to change occured.

## A03
- History challenges the view that minorities such as the suffaragettes can bring about social change quickly. There is a strong tendancy to conform to the majority position, so groups are more likely to main the status quo rather than engage in social change.
