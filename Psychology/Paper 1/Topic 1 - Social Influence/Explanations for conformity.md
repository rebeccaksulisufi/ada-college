# Normative and informational influence as explanations for conformity

## A01
### Normative social influence
- As humans are a social species, they have a fundamental need for social interaction and have a fear of rejection
- This forms normative social influence as humans need to gain approval and acceptance from society to avoid disapproval
- An important condition of normative social influence is that the individual only complies when under surveillance of the group.
- People conform in the public view but do not internalise this view into private settings
-Shows compliance
### Informational social influence
- Informational influence occurs when an individual accepts information from others to gain knowledge
- Humans need to feel that their perceptions and beliefs are correct
- The individual complies both in public and private attitude or beliefs
- Shows internalisation

## A03
- Difficult to distinguish between compliance and internalisation. Someone who publicly agrees with the majority yet disagrees with them in private must be demonstrating compliance. However it could also be possible that acceptance occurs in public but dissipates later because they have forgotten the information given by the group

- Informational influence is moderated by the type of task. Deciding whether Brighton is in the south of England can be determined by consulting statistics or census records. However other judgements such as deciding whether Brighton is the most fun city, can only be judged by a social census.
