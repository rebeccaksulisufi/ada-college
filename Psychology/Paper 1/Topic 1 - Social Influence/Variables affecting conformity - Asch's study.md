# Variables affecting conformity

## A01
- Asch tested 123 male undergraduate student to judge the length of a line to 3 comparison lines
- He seated the naive participant always 2nd from last and had 5-7 confederates
- On 12/18 of the the trials, the confederates were instructed to give the wrong answer
- On these 12 critical trials, the conformity rate was 33%
- 25% of participants never conformed
- To determine whether the results were unambiguous, he did a control trial where he had no confederates, he found that only 1% made mistakes and said the wrong answer

## Group size
- Asch found that there was little conformity when the majority consisted of just 1 or 2 confederates
- The size of a majority is important only up to a certain point

## Unanimity
- When unanimity was disturbed, conformty levels dropped significantly

## Task difficulty
- When the task was made more difficult, conformity levels increased because the answer was less obvious so people were more subjective to informational social influence

## A03
- Asch’s study is infused with gender bias. He used all male students. The results therefore may not be accurate as men tend to be shown as having a more dominant role in society, and are less prone to conforming whereas women are more quiet and are more submissive in society so the results from Asch’s study cannot be generalised to both males and females
- In Asch’s study it may have been difficult for the confederates to lie about the comparison lines convincingly, so the naive participants may have guessed the aim of the study which implements demand characteristics decreasing the validity of the study
