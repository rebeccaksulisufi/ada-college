# Milgrams study

## A01
- 40 participants were told they were involved in a study on how punishment affects learning
- A learner (who was always the confederate), a teacher who was always the volunteer
- The teacher and the learner would draw straws and the naive participant would always be the teacher
- Teacher was required to test the learners ability on word pairs
- Everytime the learner would get a wrong word pair, the teacher would administer an electric shock starting at 15v going all the way up tp 450v
- The learner would mostly give wrong answers
- If the learner hesitated, the experimenter would give a series of prods.
- All particpants administered the 300v shock
- 65% went up to 450v

## A03
- Lack of realism- the learner cried out in pain but the experiementer stayed calm which could lead to the participant guessing that the victim is not suffering any real harm
- Ethical issues- Milgram deceived his participants by telling them they were involved in a study on the effects of punishment on learning rather then telling themthe actual aim of the study which makes it impossible for participants to make an informed decision before giving their consent
