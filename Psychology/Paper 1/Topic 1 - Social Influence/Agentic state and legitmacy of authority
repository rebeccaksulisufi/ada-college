# Agentic state and legitimacy of authority

## A01
### Legitimacy of authority
- The first condition for someone to switch to the agentic state is the perception of **legitimate authority**
- People accept definitions of a situation which are provided by a legitimate authority.
- Although its the person himself performing the action, they allow the the authority figure to define its meaning
- If an authority figures commands are deemed harmful or destructive they must occur within a instutional structure (uni, military)
- One variation of Milgrams study is that he moved his study from Yale university to a run-down office building which lacked credentials but it still caused people to obey.

### Agentic state
- A common way of thinking for the obdient indivisual is ot see themselves as not being responsible for their own actions
- Instead they attribute responsibility to someone else (Agentic state)
- Agentic state refers to moving from a autonomous state, where a person sees themselves as responsible for their own actions, into an agentic state
- The individual feels resposible to the authority figure directing them but no responsibility for their actions that the authority figure dictated
- People adopt an agentic state in need to maintain a positive self image
- Actions performed under the agentic state are guilt-free however inhumane they may be
- Once a person has entered the agentic state, to leave it, they must breach the committment made to the experimenter. The person feels if they break the experiment off, they will appear rude and so binds the subject into obidience.

## A03
- If people authorise another person to make judgements for them about what is right and wrong they will feel that their own moral values are not relevent. So in future if an authority figure directs them to engage in immoral actions, they will be allarmingly willing to do so
- Milgram believed that the agentic state best explained his findings but one common belief is that participants may use these oppertunities to express their sadistic impulses
