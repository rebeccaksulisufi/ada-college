# Cognitive approach to treating depression

## A01
- Cognitive element aims to identify irrational and negative thoughts- replace negative thoughts with positive ones
- CBT encourages patients to test their beliefs through behavioural experiments and homework
- If using triad- patients will identify negative thoughts using the triad and then the therapist will challenge those irrational thoughts by discussing evidence for and against them
- If using Ellisâ€™s REBT model- therapist will dispute patients beliefs and replace their irrational beliefs with effective beliefs and attitudes

### Logical disputing - does it make sense?
### Empirical dispute - where's the evidence?
### Pragmatic dispute- is this going to make you feel any better?

- Following a session, therapists will set homework for patients where a patient identifies their own irrational beliefs and proves himself wrong

## A03
- CBT requires motivation, patients with severe depression may not engage with CBT or attend the sessions and therefore makes the treatment ineffective
- CBT accuses patients of their own thinking causing depression- which can lead to the patient feeling worse
- CBT ignores other factors which may contribute to depression (E.g a patient that is suffering from domestic violence or abuse doesn't need to change their negative beliefs but instead needs to change their circumstances
