# Bowlbys monotropic theory of attachment

## A01

- Bowlbys theoy states babies hve a **critical period** in which they have a innate drive to become attached
- Infants who do not form attachments during this time have difficulty forming attachments later on
- Bowlby proposed attachment is determined by sensitivity
- Social releasers are important during the critical period
- Smiling and having a babyface are social releasers which are innate mechanisms to explain how attachment to infants are formed
- Bowlby proposed infants have one special emotional bond which is usually the primary attachment relationship (usually the biological mother)
- Monotropy causes a mental representation of a relationship called an internal working model
- Acts as a template for all future relationships because it generates expectations about what intimate loving relationships are like
- The continuity hypothesis proposes individuals who are strongly attached in infancy, continue to be socially and emotionally compotent

## A03

- Rutter shows that the critical period is true to an extent, attachments can form beyond the period Bowlby presented but children are more receptive to the formaion of certain characteristics
- Czech twins were discovered at age 7 after being locked up from the outside world since birth. After adopted, by the age of 14, the twins showed normal social and intellectual functioning and were able to form meaningful attachments
