# Outline and evaluate caregiver-infant interactions

## A01

### Reciprocity
- Infants co-ordinated actions with caregivers in a 'conversation'. 
- From birth, babies move in a rhythm when interacting with adults, taking turns as if its a conversation
- Brazelton suggested that rhythm is important to communicate later as the regularity of an infants signals allows the caregiver to anticipate the infants behaviour and respond appropiately

### Interactional Synchrony
- Meltzoff and Moore conducted the first interactional synchrony study
- They found that infants as young as 2-3 weeks old would imitate specific facial expressions (tongue out, mouth open, lip protrusion)
- They found there was an association between the infant behaviour and the adult model


## A03

- Failure to replicate - Koepke failed to replicate Meltzoff and Moore's findings. Meltzoff and Moore stated that the research by Koepke was less carefully controlled.

- Individual differences - in interactional synchrony, there is variation between infants. Isabella et al found that more strongly attached infant-caregiver pairs showed interactional synchrony
