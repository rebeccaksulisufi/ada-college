# Romanian orphan studies- Effects on institutionalisation

## A01
- 165 Romanina children who spent their early lives in institutions and suffered effects of institutionalisation
- Of this group: 111 were adopted before 2 y/o
- Of this group: 54 were adopted between 1-4 y/o
- Adoptees were tested at regular intervals to assess their physical, cognitive and social development
- Their progress was compared to a control group of 52 British children adopted before 6 months
- At the time of adoption, Romanian orphans lagged behind the British on all measures
- They were smaller, weighed less and were classified as mentally retarde
- By the age of 4, some romanians caught up with the British
- Defecits remain in a minority of individuals who were institutionalised beyond the age of 6 months
- This suggests long term consequences may be less severe then was once thought of
- When children do not form attachments the consequences are severe

## A03
- Some research suggests that individuals who do not form a primary attachment within the sensitive period are unable to recover but it isnt true for all children. Rutter has suggested that it might be that some of the children did recieve special attention in the institution  because they smiled more and would show early attachment experiences. Bowlbys study of children with TB showed that that were individual differences in the way children cope.
- institutionalisation may just be slow development. The effcts of institutionalisation disappear if children have good-quality emotionall compare. Ex-institutionalised children need more time than normal to mature sufficiently and learn how to cope with relationships
