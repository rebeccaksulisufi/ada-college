# Schaffer and Emersonâ€™s stages of attachment

## A01
- Schaffer and emerson conducted a study on attachment. The findings of their study construct a description of how attachment develops

### Stage 1: Indiscriminate attachment

- From 0 - 2 months
- Infants produce similar responses to all objects regardless whether they are animate or inanimate
- Towards the end of the period, infants show greater preference for social stimuli such as smiling faces
- Reciprocity and interactional synchrony

### Stage 2: The beginnings of attachment

- Around 4 months infants become more social
- They prefer human company to inanimate objects
- Do not yet show anxiety with strangers

### Stage 3: Discriminate attachment

- Start to show separation anxiety
- Form a specific attachment with the primary caregiver
- Had more attachment to those who responded to their singlas more sensitively

### Stage 4: Multiple attachments

- After 1 year
- The infant starts to develop attachments with multiple people
- Siblings, grandparents, aunties, uncles
- Called secondary attachments

## A03

- The data collected by Schaffer and Emerson may be unreliable as it was based on mothers own report on their infants. Some mothers may be less sensitive to their infants protests and would be less likely to report them

- Times have changed, and more men stay home to look after children now and becomes the main carer. It is highly likely that if a similar study to Schaffer and Emerson was conducted today, the findings might be different.
