# Effect of anxiety on EWT

## A01
- Anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state that is accompanied by increased heart rate and rapid breathing
### Anxiety having a negative effect on recall
#### Johnson&Scott
- Asked participants to sit in a waiting room where they heard an argument next door
- When they saw a man run through with a pen in his hand with ink all over his arm, the participants had 49% accuracy
- When they saw a man run though with a knife in his hand covered in ‘blood’, participants have 33% accuracy
- Shows anxiety focuses on the central features of the crime (e.g a weapon)
### Anxiety have a positive effect on recall
#### Christianson&Hubinette
- Questions 58 real witnesses to bank robberies 4-5 months after the robbery
- All witnesses showed good recall
- 75% accurate recall
- Witnesses who were most anxious had the best recall

## A03
- Findings are contradictory- Yerkes Dodson Law states that there is an optimal level this means that high levels of stress is not good for recall neither is low levels of stress instead the law argues that you need a moderate amount of anxiety to increase recall.
- Pickel proposed that reduces accuracy of identification due to the weapon focus effect could be due to surprise rather than anxiety. She arranged for participants to watch a thief enter a salon carrying scissors(high threat, low surprise), handgun (high threat, high surprise), wallet(low threat, low surprise) and a whole chicken (low treat, high surprise). Identification was least accurate in the high surprise conditions which show that weapons focus is related to surprise rather than anxiety,
