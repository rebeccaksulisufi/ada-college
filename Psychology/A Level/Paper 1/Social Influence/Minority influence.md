# Research into minority influence - Moscovici

## A01
In order to convert a majority to the minority, they must be 3 things:
### Consistency
- If the minority adopts a **consistent** approach, others will reassess the situation more carefully
### Committment
- **Committment** is importan in the influence process because it suggets certainty, confidence and courage, in the face of the majority.
### Flexibility
- Flexibility is more effective at changing majority option than rigidity . As the minority is powerless to the majority, they must negotiate their position
### Moscovici
- Each group had 4 naive participants and 2 confederates
- They were shown blue slides which varied in intensitiy and wer asked to judge the colour of each slide
- In the consistent condition,the confederates called the blue slides green on every trial. In the inconsistent condition, they called the slides green on 2/3 of the trial. In a control condition, there was 6 naive participants and no confederates where the paticipants called the slides blue throughout
- Findings show that tthe consistent minority influenced the naive participants to say green on over 8% of the trials

## A03
- A study on flexibility was stimulated in a jury situation where group members discussed the amount of compensation to be paid to someone involved in a ski-lift  accident. When a confederate put foward an alternative point of view and refused to change their position, this had no effect on other group members. A confederate who compromised and showed a degree of shift towards the minority **did** exert an influence on the rest of the group
- A researcher argues that the views of minority do not necessarily lead to greater processing, but rather its the majority who are more likely to create greater  message processing. People tend to believe that the majority of group members share similar beliefs to ours so they dont waste time listening to the minority
