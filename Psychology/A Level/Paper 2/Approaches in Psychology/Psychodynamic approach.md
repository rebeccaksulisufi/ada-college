#Psychodynamic approach

## A01

- The model was founded my Freud in the 20th century
- States that all behaviour is the result of the unconscious mind (not aware for true reason for our action)
- Most development occurs during childhood, personality is formed during critical period 0-3y
- Our parents (specifically primary caregiver) can be blamed for out abnormal behaviour
- The model is deterministic, states we do not have free will. We do not have a conscious choice regarding our behaviour since its caused by factors were not aware of
- Trauma that happens during the critical period is repressed and can cause later emotional problems
- We are susceptible to trauma at this age as our ego is not fully developed and we cannot manage conflict well
- When we encounter trauma, we use coping mechanisms to help us cope (denial, repression, displacement or projection)
- Excessive use of coping mechanisms can lead to abnormality (e.g, excessive use of repression may cause forgetfulness)
- The psyche is made up of 3 parts. (1) The id, the pleasure principle. (2) The ego, the reality principle. (3) The superego, the morality principle.
- Interaction between these can cause abnormality (e.g a dominant id can cause aggression)
- Abnormality may also be caused by fixation at one of the psychosexual stages (e.g over-gratification of the libido at the oral stage can cause oral-optimism and under-gratification can cause oral-pessimism)

## A03

- Freud's views were based on his observations of men and his views on women were far less developed.
- Freud ignored the extent to which female sexuality differed from male sexuality and was often ignorant to woman and their sexual life
- This has led critics to break away from Freud's theory and found a feminist psychoanalysis

***

- Sue and Sue argue that psychoanalysis is not relevant to non-Western cultures.
- Psychoanalysts believe that mental disorders are the result of repressed in the unconscious and freeing this material in a supportive environment is key to recovering from disorder
- However non-Western cultures do not value insight as much. In China and Japan, it is more beneficial to avoid thoughts which bring distress, and people are not usually willing to discuss them openly.

***

- The theory is extremely comprehensive
- It provides a method of explanation and treatment for disorders
- Has been used to understand many aspects of human behaviour
- This has given critics a new way of gaining insight into a range of literary texts (e.g the hidden theme of repression in *Hamlet*)
