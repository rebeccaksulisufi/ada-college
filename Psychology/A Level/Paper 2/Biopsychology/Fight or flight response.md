# Fight or flight response

## A01
### Response to acute stressors
- The SNS sends a signal to the adrenal medulla
- Adrenal medulla releases (nor)adrenaline into the bloodstream
- As adrenaline circulates through the body: heart beats faster/pushing blood to muscles/blood pressure increases
- Breathing becomes more rapid in order to make in as much oxygen with each breath
- When the threat has passed the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system dampens down the stress response : slows down heart rate/blood pressure

### Response to ongoing stressors
- The HPA axis relies on hormonal signals to keep the SNS working
- The hypothalamus relases a chemical messenger into the bloodstream
- On arrival at the pituitary gland, the messenger causes the pituitary to produce and release ACTH
- ACTH is transported in the bloodstream to the adrenal glands
- ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol
- Cortisol provides a quick burst of energy and a lower sensitivity to pain

## A03
- Stressors of modern life rarely require such levels of physical activity - increased blood pressure can lead to physical damage in blood vessels and eventually to heart disease
- Gray argues that the first phase of reaction to a threat is not the fight or flee but to avoid confrontation. Prior to responding with attacking or running away, most animals freeze and stay alert to the slightest sight of danger
