# Localisation of function

## A01

- Localisation is the principle that specific functions (language, memory, hearing, etc) have specific locations within the brain
- Gall's theory was that the structure of the skull would determine a person's character
- Using animal experimentation, it was discovered that the main divisions of the brain were resposible for different functions

#### Motor cortex

- Responsible for voluntary motor movements
- Located in the frontal lobe
- Both hemispheres have a motor cortex, with the side of the brain controlling muscles on the opposite side of the body.

#### Somatosensory cortex

- Detects sensory events from different regions of the body
- Located in parietal lobe
- Somatosensory cortex produces sensations of touch, pressure and pain which it then localises to specific body regions
- Both hemispheres have a Somatosensory cortex, with the side of the brain controlling muscles on the opposite side of the body.

#### Visual centres

- Primary visual centre is located in the visual cortex in the occipital lobe in the brain
- Visual processing begins in the retina (back of eye)
- Nerve impulses from the retina are transmitted via the optic nerve
- The visual cortex spans both hemispheres:
- The right hemisphere receives input from the left visual field, and the left hemisphere receives input from the right visual field

#### Auditory centres

- Auditory centre in the brain is concerned with hearing
- Area lies within the temporal lobes
- Sound impulses in the inner ear are converted to nerve impulses which travel via the auditory nerve to the auditory cortex in the brain
- It stops at the brain stem where decoding takes place (duration/intensity of sound)
- Then it stops at the thalamus which acts a relay station
- The last stop is the auditory cortex and it will respond accordingly.

#### Broca's Area
 = Area is named after a neurosurgeon who treated a patient which could only express one syllable
