# Outline and evaluate explanation of phobias

## A01
### Classical conditioning:
- Learnt through association
#### PAVLOV:
- showed a dog could be conditioned to salivate at the sound of a bell if that bell was repeatedly presented at the same time they were given food.
- UNCONDITIONED STIMULUS = FOOD
- UNCONDITIONED RESPONSE = SALIVATION
- NEUTRAL STIMULUS = BELL
- CONDITIONED STIMULUS = BELL
- CONDITIONED RESPONSE = SALIVATION

### Operant conditioning:
- BF Skinner argued learning is an active process. If consequences are pleasant they repeat the behaviour, if they are unpleasant they do not repeat the behaviour
- Positive reinforcement: is receiving a reward.
- Negative reinforcement: occurs when performing an action stops something unpleasant happening
- Punishment: this is an unpleasant consequence. For example being grounded for not doing your psychology homework.
#### SKINNER BOX:
- Rat was placed in a cage, every time he pushed a lever down, a pellet of food would drop (positive reinforcement)
- In another experiment rats were placed in a cage that gives electric shocks, they had to pull a level down to stop it.
- Rats learnt to go straight towards the level when put in the box


## A03
- Experiments were carried out on animals not humans and we are cognitively different
- Watson and Rayner showed that phobias can be learnt through classical conditioning in the “little Albert” experiment.
- A final criticism of classical conditioning theory is that it is deterministic. This means that it does not allow for any degree of free will in the individual. Accordingly, a person has no control over the reactions they have learned from classical conditioning, such as a phobia.
