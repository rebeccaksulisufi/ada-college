# Divisions of the nervous system

## Central nervous system
- Comprises of the brain and spinal cord
- Has 2 main functions- control of behaviour (1) / regulation of the bodys physiological processes (2)
- Brain must be able to receieve information from all sensory receptors and send messages to muscles and glands of the bodys

### Spinal cord
- Relay information between the brain and the rest of the bodys
- Allows brain to monitor and regulate bodily processes
- Spinal cord contains circuits of nerve cells that enable us to perform simple reflexes without the direct involvement of the Brain

 ### Brain
 - Has 4 parts = cerebrum, cerebellum, diencephalon, and brain system
- **Cerebrum** - divded into 4 seperate lobes / each part is specialised for paticular behaviours
- **Cerebellum** - controls a persons motor skills and balance / abnormalities of this area can result in epilepsy and speech
- /motor problems
- **Diencephalon** - Contains thalamus and hypothalamus.
Thalamus - relay station for nerve impulses routing them to the appropiate part of the brain where they can be processed
Hyppthalamus - regulates body temp, hunger and thirst
- **Brain stem** - regulates the automatic funtions which are essential for life (breathing, heartbeat and swallowing)

## Peripheral nervous system
- All nerves outside the CNS make up the personsRelays nerve impulses from the CNS to the rest of the body and vise versa
- There are 2 main divisions of the PNS

### Somatic nervous system
- 12 pairs of cranial nerves
- 31 pairs of spinal nerves
- Nerves have both sensory and motor neurons
- Sensory neurons relay messages to the CNS
- Motor neurons relay messages from the CNS to other parts of the body
- Involved in reflex actions

### Autonomic nervous system
- Involuntary actions are regulated by the ANS
- Vital bodily functions would not work efficiently without them
- Has 2 parts

#### Sympathetic nervous system
- Involved in responses that help us to deal with emergencies (increased heartrate/blood pressure)
- Neurons from the SNS travel to every organ and gland within the body
- Prepares the body for everything rapid action necessary when the individual is under threat
- SNS causes body to release stored energy, pupuils to dilate
- Slows down bodily processes that are less important in emergencies (urination/digestion)

#### Parasympathetic nervous system
- Relaxes the individual once the emergency has passed
- PNS slows heartbeat down and reduces blood pressure
