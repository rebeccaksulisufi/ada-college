# The endocrine system

## Glands and hormones

### Endocrine Glands
- Produce and secrete hormones
- Regulates the activity of cells or organs in the body
- Major glands include, pituitary gland, adrenal gland, ovaries and testes
- Each gland produces different hormones
- A signal is sent from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland in the form of a releasing hormone which causes the pituitary to secrete a stimulating hormone into the bloodstream.
- This hormone then signals the target gland to secret *its* hormone. A
- As levels of this hormone rise in the bloodstream, the hypothalamus shuts down the secretion of the relapsing hormone and the pituitary gland shuts down the secretion of the stimulating hormone which slows down the secretion of the targets gland hormone resulting in stable concentrations of hormones in the bloodstream

### Hormones
- Chemicals in the bloodstream
- Carried to target sites throughout the body
- Hormones only affect a limited number of cells
- Target cells respond to a particular hormone because they have receptors for that hormone
- Cells that do not have such a receptor cannot be influenced by that hormones
- When enough receptor sites are stimulated by hormones, this results in a physiological reaction in the target cell
- Too much or too little hormones can result in dysfunction of bodily systems


## Pituitary gland
- Produces hormones whose function is to influence the release of hormones from other glands which regulates the body's functions
- The pituitary is controlled by the hypothalamus
- The hypothalamus receives information from many sources about the basic functions of the body which then uses this information to help regulate these functions
- The pituitary produces hormones either directly cause changes in process or stimulate other glands to produce hormones
- High levels of hormones can stop the hypothalamus and pituitary releasing their own hormones
- The pituitary relapses ACTH as a response to stress
- ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol

## Adrenal Glands
- Sit on top of the kidneys
- Outer part is adrenal cortex
- Inner part is adrenal medulla
- Adrenal cortex produces cortisol which regulates bodily functions
- Cortisol production is increased in response to stress
- Adrenal medulla releases (nor)adrenaline which prepare the body for fight or flight.
- Adrenaline helps body respond to stressful situations
