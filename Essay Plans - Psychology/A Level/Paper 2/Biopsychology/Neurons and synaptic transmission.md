# Neurons and synaptic transmission

## Structure and function of neurons
- Neurons are cells that are specialised to carry neural information throughout the body
- Neurons typically consist of a cell body, dendrites and an axon
- Dendrites receive signals from other neurons or from sensory receptors
- Dendrites are connected to the cell body
- From the cell body, the impulse is carried along the axon where it terminates at the axon terminal
- There is an insulating layer that forms around the axon called the myelin sheath which allows nerve impulses to transmit more rapidly along the axon

### Sensory Neurons
- Carry nerve impulses from sensory receptors to the spinal cord/brain
- Sensory receptors are found in various locations in the bed
- Sensory neurons convert information from these sensory receptors into neural impulses
- When the impulses reach the brain they are translated to sensation so the organism can react properly

### Relay neurons
- Allow motor and sensory neurons to communicate with each other
- Lie within the brain and spinal cord

### Motor neurons
- Are neurons located in the PNS that project their axons outside the PNS and control muscles
- Form synapses with muscles and control their contractions
- Releases neurotransmitters that bind to receptors on the muscle which trigger a response which leads to muscle movement
- When the axon of a motor neuron fires, the muscle with which it has formed synapses with, contracts
- Muscle relaxation is caused by inhibition of the motor neuron

## Synaptic transmission
- Information is passed down the axon of the neuron as an electrical impulse known as action potential.
- Once the action potential reaches the end of the axon it needs to be transferred to another neuron or tissue.
- It must cross over the synaptic gap between the presynaptic neuron and post-synaptic neuron.
- At the end of the neuron (in the axon terminal) are the synaptic vesicles, which contain chemical messengers, known as neurotransmitters.
- When the electrical impulse (action potential) reaches these synaptic vesicles, they release their contents of neurotransmitters.
- Neurotransmitters then carry the signal across the synaptic gap.
- They bind to receptor sites on the post-synaptic cell, thereby completing the process of synaptic transmission.

Neurotransmitters then carry the signal across the synaptic gap. They bind to receptor sites on the post-synaptic cell that then become activated. Once the receptors have been activated, they either produce excitatory or inhibitory effects on the post-synaptic cell.

## Inhibitory and Excitatory Neurotransmitters

- Excitatory neurotransmitters (e.g. noradrenaline) make the post-synaptic cell more likely to fire,
- Inhibitory neurotransmitters (e.g. GABA) make them less likely to fire.
For example, if an excitatory neurotransmitter like noradrenaline binds to the post-synaptic receptors it will cause an electrical charge in the cell membrane which results in an excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP), which makes the post-synaptic cell more likely to fire.
Whereas, if an inhibitory neurotransmitter like GABA binds to the post-synaptic receptors it will result in an inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP), which makes the post-synaptic cell less likely to fire.
