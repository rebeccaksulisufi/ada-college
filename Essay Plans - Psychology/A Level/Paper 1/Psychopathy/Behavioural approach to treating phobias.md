# Treatment of phobias

## A01
### Flooding
- Sudden exposure to the phobic stimulus
- Realistic to real life situations
- Surrounded by phobic stimulus

### Systematic desensitisation
- Reciprocal inhibition
- Gradual exposure
- Cannot be in 2 contradictory states at the same time (E.g stressed/relaxed)
- Desensitization hierarchy
- Counter-conditioning
- Invitro/inviro
- Usually 4-6 sessions or 12 for a severe phobia

## A03
- Flooding is cheap and quick
- Flooding is highly traumatic (possible heart attack)
- Absence of disturbing elements in SD makes the technique less likely to provoke the abandonment of the therapy
- Some people are unable to imagine a fearful situations
