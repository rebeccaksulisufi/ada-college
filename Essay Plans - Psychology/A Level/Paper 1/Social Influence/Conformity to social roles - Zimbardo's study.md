# Conformity to social roles - Zimbardos study

## A01
- Mock prison was set up in the basement of Stanford university
- 24 male students were screened for psychological health and sadism
- Randomly assigned to play prisoner or guard
- Prisoners were unexpectedly arrested at home
- Prisoners were deloused/given smocks/assigned an ID number
- Guards referred to the prisoners only as ID numbers
- Guards were given uniforms/dark sunglasses
- Guards woke prisoners up in the night and forced them to clean the toilets with their bare hands
- One prisoner asked for 'parole' rather than asking to be withdrawn from the study
- 5 prisoners left early due to extreme reactions
- Study was terminated after 6 days as it was discovered it was unethical
- Shows that both guards and prisoners conformed to their social roles

## A03
- Conformity to social roles is not automatic- some guards performed sadistic behaviour but other guards did not degrade or harras the prisoners, and some even did little favours for the prisoners which show that the guards ***chose*** how to act and were not forced to

- The study provokes demand characteristics. Banuazizi presented some of the details of the SPE to students who had never heard of the study. The vast majority correctly guessed the aim of the study was to  show that ordinary people assigned the role of the guard or prisoner would act like real prisoners and guards
