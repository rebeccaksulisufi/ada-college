# Unit 3

## Smart Goals

### Specific:
- The goal should target a specific area of improvement or answer a specific need.

### Measurable:
- The goal must be quantifiable, or at least allow for measurable progress.

### Attainable:
- The goal should be realistic, based on available resources and existing constraints.

## Relevant:
- The goal should align with other business objectives to be considered worthwhile.

### Time-bound:
- The goal must have a deadline or defined end.

## Business case
The current order processing system is inefficient and unreliable. There are two options:
1. buy a ready-made product and attempt to customise it for our needs OR
2. design and build our own system using in-house expertise. (this one has been chosen)

The expected business benefit of the project is a measurable improvement in our order processing. It is expected to:
- increase the number of orders handled from 25 per day to at least 30 per day for each sales person.
- reduce the rate of mistakes with orders, dropping from the current 18% to under 5%, which in turn will lead to a cost saving of over £8000 per year over the next 5 years.

Timescale/Budget:
- The project should begin in mid-October with the system going live on 5th April (for the start of the new tax year).
- The beta version should go live early February to allow for 2 months of parallel running to ensure it can handle the full range of orders correctly.
- The company has allocated £41000 of budget to this project.
- It expects a return of at least £3000 at the end of 5 years (cost savings) and increased sales revenue of at least 15%.

The major risk is that new technologies and processes will be used on this project as part of our continuing staff development, which may result in unforeseen problems, hold-ups and extra costs.

### What are the benefits of this busness case
Financial benefit is one benefit set out in the business case.
What do you understand by return of investment? What is the expected return on investment for this project?
How would you measure if the outcome was a success?

- There will be more user satisfaction as there will be less errors
- Production quality will increase as the efficiency will also increased
- If most smart goals are met, the project is a successfully

## Risk management
**As a result of** significant competition in the market for this kind of product,

**there is a risk** that a competitor might release their product before us,

**which would result in** reduced market share - and therefore profitability - for our product.
### Brief:
Ada has to move to a new building in the same area which will accommodate more students. New laptops will be provided to the students. The securty of the building has to be considered.
IDENTIFY 5 RISKS AND WRITE THEM IN THE CAUSE, EVENT, AND CONSEQUENCE STRUCTURE

**As a result of** significant competition in the market for this kind of product,

**there is a risk** that a competitor might release their product before us,

**which would result in** reduced market share - and therefore profitability - for our product.

1) As a result of new laptops being provided, there is an increased risk of theft of the building to take the laptops, which would result in student data being lost and college losing their property

2) As a result of there being a fire, there is a risk that everyone in the builsing could get hurt and/or the whole building could burn which would result in students unable to come to college

3)As the result of a power surge, there is a risk that there will be no power in the building which will lead to studets being unable to access the internet to do their work and possibly not be able to come to college due to there being no electricity/lights



In case of a power surge, there is a risk that there will be no power in the building. No live wires should be exposed for the safety of everyone in the building
